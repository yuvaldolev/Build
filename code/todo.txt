* [X] Check switch parsing in build_parser.cpp

* [ ] Profile the lexer and decide if saving the next token is necessary when peeking
(currently the next token is not saved). Maybe get a token when the tokenizer is initialized
 and then when the user wants to peek on a token - just return the previously lexed token which
 is actually the next token (we're always one token ahead).
 
 *****************************************************************************************************
 * [X] Decide if I want to move Kind enums back to the global namespace. Now they are inside structs *
 *****************************************************************************************************
 
 * [ ] Maybe dereference struct pointers when using the dot operator from within the parser instead of
 checking if the node is a pointer in the cpp converter (will spare checking in other converters).
 
 * [ ] Parse pointers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
 * [ ] Make sure optional_token and peek_token have the save performance.
 Right now peek_token is more performent
 
 * [X] Currently errors reported from require_token cause a lot of other errors to be reported.
 Fix that!

 * [ ] Implement a way to look at AST Nodes in groups (for example: looking at the next ast node) *
