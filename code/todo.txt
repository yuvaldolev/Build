* [X] Check switch parsing in build_parser.cpp
* [ ] Profile the lexer and decide if saving the next token is necessary when peeking
(currently the next token is not saved). Maybe get a token when the tokenizer is initialized
 and then when the user wants to peek on a token - just return the previously lexed token which
 is actually the next token (we're always one token ahead).
